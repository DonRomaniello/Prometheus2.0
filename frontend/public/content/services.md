# Services

Welcome to our services page! This page was automatically generated by our integration script.

## Our Services

- **Web Development**: Modern React applications
- **Content Management**: Markdown-powered content systems
- **Automation**: Scripts that make development easier

## How It Works

When you create a new `.md` file in the content directory, our script automatically:

1. Creates a new page component
2. Adds a route to the router
3. Updates the navigation menu
4. Makes everything work seamlessly!

## Get Started

Simply create a new markdown file and run:
```bash
npm run generate-pages
```

Or use the watch mode to automatically detect changes:
```bash
npm run watch-content
```
