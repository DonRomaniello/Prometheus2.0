# About Prometheus 2.0

Prometheus 2.0 is a modern React application that allows you to manage content through markdown files while providing seamless navigation and consistent styling.

## How It Works

1. **Content Management**: Write your content in markdown files stored in `src/content/`
2. **Automatic Routing**: Each markdown file automatically becomes a navigable page
3. **Consistent Rendering**: All content is rendered through a standardized component for uniform appearance

## Technology Stack

- **React 19**: Latest version for modern component development
- **React Router**: Client-side routing for seamless navigation
- **React Markdown**: Reliable markdown parsing and rendering
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped styling for maintainable CSS

## Editing Content

To edit any page content:
1. Navigate to the corresponding `.md` file in `src/content/`
2. Edit the markdown content
3. Save the file
4. The changes will appear immediately in the app
