# Grid Demo

Welcome to our grid system demonstration! This page showcases the new semantic grid layouts.

## Layout Examples

This page demonstrates different grid layout options available in our CSS system.

### Two Column Layout
Perfect for content with sidebar navigation or supplementary information.

### Three Equal Columns  
Great for displaying feature lists, team members, or services.

### Auto-Responsive Grids
Automatically adjusts column count based on available space - perfect for card layouts.

### Full Page Layouts
Complete page structures with header, main content, sidebar, and footer areas.

The grid system uses `grid-template-areas` which makes layouts semantic and easy to understand at a glance!
