# About Prometheus Studios

## Purposeful

Prometheus Studios provides opportunities for the study and practice of long form improvisation in the city of Beacon.

As the performing arts flourish in the Hudson Valley, we aim to contribute world-class improv instruction to underpin this growth.

## Unique

We're small. Just one instructor and one class at a time.

## Lineage

Improv in the United States grew out of a WPA project that used improv to teach acting to those that wouldn't otherwise have access to the stage.

The grounded, humanist approach to improvisation practiced at Prometheus Studios connects to the living art.

## Students

We offer introductory courses as well as bleeding-edge classes where students have participated in the world premiere of new forms.

Students explore not just the art of improvisation, but the practical side of the craft as well. Students are involved in the production of their class shows and share in the proceeds from ticket sales.
