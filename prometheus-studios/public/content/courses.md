## The Reset

Many approaches to improv are indexed on a different performance medium. Improvised plays, improvised musical theatre, improvised debates, improvised sketch comedy, improvised movies...

Performers trained in these styles often have very specific crystalized skills, which are treated like the gems they are: precious, hard, and important to display.

To help performers from other improvised media prepare for the holistic approach at Prometheus Studios, there is The Reset.

## Solid Foundations

For new students, or for former students of iO or The Magnet that want to begin improvising again.


## How It Works

When you create a new `.md` file in the content directory, our script automatically:

1. Creates a new page component
2. Adds a route to the router
3. Updates the navigation menu
4. Makes everything work seamlessly!

## Get Started

Simply create a new markdown file and run:
```bash
npm run generate-pages
```

Or use the watch mode to automatically detect changes:
```bash
npm run watch-content
```
