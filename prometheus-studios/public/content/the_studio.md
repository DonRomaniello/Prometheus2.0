When Ania’s not on stage, she’s securing your data, locking down physical perimeters, or quietly tailing someone through a Whole Foods parking lot. By day, she’s a cybersecurity strategist. By night, she’s an amateur private detective (available for hire, obviously). 

Please don’t ask what her notebook contains. You’re not cleared for that.
