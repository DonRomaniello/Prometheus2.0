# Prometheus Studios

Prometheus Studios is a long form improv studio.

We practice grounded improvised scenework and long form improvisation.

## Courses

Our classes are concise, focused, and competent.

A carefully scaffolded curriculum rapidly introduces students to the cutting edge of long form improvisation.


## Development

Prometheus Studios has been both the birthplace and incubator of new formats and shows.

Students participate in bleeding edge approaches to long form improvisation.

## Productions

Production is limited to class shows and collaborations across media.


Prometheus Studios is based out of the City of Beacon in the beautiful Hudson Valley region of New York.
